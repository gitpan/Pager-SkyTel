Pager::SkyTel

Description:

Pager::SkyTel.pm is the beginnings of a module to control the account 
options for a SkyTel pager from a perl script.  Currently, 
Pager::SkyTel.pm implements the forwarding features available on the 
SkyTel customer service website.

fwd_skytel is a script which uses Pager::SkyTel.pm to forward a skytel 
pager to another pager, e-mail address or phone number.

Required Modules:

  HTTP::Cookies - For maintaining login state with the SkyTel web server

  LWP::UserAgent - For communicating with the SkyTel web server.

  URI - For manipulating URLs.

  Date::Manip - For flexible date formats including formats like 
  '3 weeks from today'.

Windows Users: 

You need to set a TZ variable to your timezone for the date calculations 
to work correctly.  To do this, open the properties of "My Computer" 
and set a SYSTEM variable TZ to your timezone.  I suggest using the
form "EST5EDT" so you don't have to change it every 6 months when going
to or from daylight savings time.

SSL/HTTPS Notes:

If you receive the message: "501 Protocol scheme 'https' is not supported"
you do not have SSL installed and Pager::SkyTel will not be able to communicate
with the SkyTel web server.  Pager::SkyTel uses LWP::UserAgent for it's https 
support which in turn uses either IO::Socket::SSL or Crypt::SSLeay.  Therefore,
if you install one of them, things should work much better.  See the README.SSL
file which comes with LWP::UserAgent (in the libwww-perl package.)
